### Participants
**Alexandre de Paiva Almeida** and **Luiz Guilherme Amadi Braga**

### About
A student management system is a software application that helps educational institutions to manage student data and handle various student-related tasks. It can be used to store and organize information such as student personal and contact details, enrollment information, grades, and attendance records.

### Requirements
My group have been assigned to make a registration system in your college subjects, which the most important system entities are: **student** and **discipline**.Your system must be able to store a list of students and the list of disciplines registered by period (for example 2018.2)

Each student must have a **code** (5 digits), name and CPF and each subject must have a **code** (4 digits), name, teacher and amount of credits.

All structures must be dynamically allocated, insertion and removal options must be allowed in all lists, through an options menu. In addition, queries of a student's subjects must be allowed in a given period and of students who are enrolled in a discipline, also in a certain period.

Finally, the system must allow saving and recovering of data between sessions.

## Execution
To execute de code in the terminal, first, use the command $gcc main.c func.o -o main.exe$ and, then, use the command $.\main.exe$. In case of changes in the library, use the command $gcc -o func.o func.c -c$.
